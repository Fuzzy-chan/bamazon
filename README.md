The purpose of this project is to create a node based application that interacts with a mySQL database.

The project has 3 possible levels of interaction.

1: The Customer level allows a user to "buy" thing from the database and that will increment the quantity and tell the user how much they have spend.

2: The Manager level allows a user to add new products or change existing products. There is also some functionality for showing what inventory is at less than 5 quantity.

3: The Supervisor level allows a user to check for total profit based off of set values for each item. Additionally, each product will fall under a department and the user will be able to see total profit by department as well.
